# Code in n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/#code-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n is a low-code tool. This means you can do a lot without code, then add code when needed.

## Code in your workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/#code-in-your-workflows "Permanent link")

There are two places in your workflows where you can use code:

- **Expressions**

Use [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#expression-n8n) to transform [data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/) in your nodes. You can use JavaScript in expressions, as well as n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) and [Data transformation functions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/).

[Expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/)

- **Code node**

Use the Code node to add JavaScript or Python to your workflow.

[Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/)

## Other technical resources [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/#other-technical-resources "Permanent link")

These are features that are relevant to technical users.

### Technical nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/#technical-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n provides core nodes, which simplify adding key functionality such as API requests, webhooks, scheduling, and file handling.

- **Write a backend**

The [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/), [Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/), and [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/) nodes help you make API calls, respond to webhooks, and write any JavaScript in your workflow.

## n8n Integrations Overview

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#integrations)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/index.md "Edit this page")

# Integrations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#integrations "Permanent link")

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

## Built-in nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#built-in-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

## Community nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#community-nodes "Permanent link")

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#credential-only-nodes-and-custom-operations "Permanent link")

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

- Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
- Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

Refer to [Custom operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

## Generic integrations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#generic-integrations "Permanent link")

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

## Where to go next [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#where-to-go-next "Permanent link")

- If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) section.
- Check out [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/usage/) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
- If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), [Actions](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/), and [Triggers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/).
- If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/) section.

## n8n Glossary

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-agent)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/glossary.md "Edit this page")

# Glossary

#### AI agent [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-agent "Permanent link")

AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.

#### AI chain [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-chain "Permanent link")

AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).

#### AI embedding [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-embedding "Permanent link")

Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.

#### AI memory [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-memory "Permanent link")

In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.

#### AI tool [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-tool "Permanent link")

In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.

#### AI vector store [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#ai-vector-store "Permanent link")

Vector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.

#### API [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#api "Permanent link")

APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.

#### canvas (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#canvas-n8n "Permanent link")

The canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.

#### cluster node (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#cluster-node-n8n "Permanent link")

In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.

#### credential (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n "Permanent link")

In n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.

#### data pinning (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#data-pinning-n8n "Permanent link")

Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.

#### editor (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#editor-n8n "Permanent link")

The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.

#### entitlement (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#entitlement-n8n "Permanent link")

In n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.

Floating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.

#### evaluation (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#evaluation-n8n "Permanent link")

In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.

#### expression (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#expression-n8n "Permanent link")

In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.

#### LangChain [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#langchain "Permanent link")

LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.

#### Large language model (LLM) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#large-language-model-llm "Permanent link")

Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.

#### node (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#node-n8n "Permanent link")

In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.

#### project (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#project-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.

#### root node (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#root-node-n8n "Permanent link")

Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.

#### sub node (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#sub-node-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.

#### template (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#template-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.

#### trigger node (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#trigger-node-n8n "Permanent link")

A trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.

#### workflow (n8n) [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#workflow-n8n "Permanent link")

An n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.

## Data Processing in n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/#data)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/index.md "Edit this page")

# Data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/#data "Permanent link")

Data is the information that n8n nodes receive and process. For basic usage of n8n you don't need to understand data structures and manipulation. However, it becomes important if you want to:

- Create your own node
- Write custom [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#expression-n8n)
- Use the Function or Function Item node

This section covers:

- [Data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/)
- [Data flow within nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-flow-nodes/)
- [Transforming data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/transforming-data/)
- [Process data using code](https://docs.n8n.io/data/code/)
- [Pinning](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/) and [editing](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/) data during workflow development.
- [Data mapping](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/) and [Item linking](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): how data items link to each other.

## Related resources [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/#related-resources "Permanent link")

### Data transformation nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/#data-transformation-nodes "Permanent link")

n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data:

- [Aggregate](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- [Limit](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
- [Remove Duplicates](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
- [Sort](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
- [Split Out](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
- [Summarize](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Text courses [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/#text-courses "Permanent link")

If you've found your way here, it means you're serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.

These tasks can and should be automated! And you don't need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this–with no-code tools like n8n, automation is for everyone.

## Available courses [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/#available-courses "Permanent link")

## Create n8n Workflows

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/#create-a-workflow)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/create.md "Edit this page")

# Create a workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/#create-a-workflow "Permanent link")

A [workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#workflow-n8n) is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the [workflow canvas](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#canvas-n8n).

## Create a workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/#create-a-workflow_1 "Permanent link")

1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png)**button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
2. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

Or:

1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png)**create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.
2. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

## Run workflows manually [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/#run-workflows-manually "Permanent link")

You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.

To run manually, select **Test Workflow**.

## Run workflows automatically [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/#run-workflows-automatically "Permanent link")

All new workflows are inactive by default.

You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.

To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle **Inactive** / **Active**.

Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.

### Node types [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/#node-types "Permanent link")

This feature uses [Cluster nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/): groups of [root](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/) and [sub](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) nodes that work together.

[Cluster nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

# API pagination [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/api/pagination/#api-pagination "Permanent link")

The default page size is 100 results. You can change the page size limit. The maximum permitted size is 250.

When a response contains more than one page, it includes a cursor, which you can use to request the next pages.

For example, say you want to get all active workflows, 150 at a time.

Get the first page:

|                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Workflow Settings

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/#workflow-settings)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/settings.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow settings [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/#workflow-settings "Permanent link")

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

To open the settings:

1. Open your workflow.
2. Select the **Options**![Options menu](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu.
3. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.

The following settings are available:

- **Execution order**: choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows. **v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on. **v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
- **Error Workflow**: select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [Error workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/error-handling/) for more details.
- **This workflow can be called by**: choose whether other workflow can call this workflow.
- **Timezone**: sets the timezone for the workflow to use. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The timezone setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node.
- **Save failed production executions**: whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.
- **Save successful production executions**: whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.
- **Save manual executions**: whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.
- **Save execution progress**: whether n8n should save execution data for each node. If set to **Save**, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This might increase latency.
- **Timeout Workflow**: toggle to enable setting a duration after which n8n should cancel the current workflow execution.
  - **Timeout After**: Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.

## External Secrets Management

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#external-secrets)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/external-secrets.md "Edit this page")

# External secrets [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#external-secrets "Permanent link")

Feature availability

- External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans.
- n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault.
- n8n doesn't support [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets).

You can use an external secrets store to manage [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) for n8n.

n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple [n8n environments](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/) in one central place.

## Connect n8n to your secrets store [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#connect-n8n-to-your-secrets-store "Permanent link")

Secret names

Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters ( `a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`), and underscores.

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** \> **External Secrets**.
2. Select **Set Up** for your store provider.
3. Enter the credentials for your provider:

   - Azure Key Vault: Provide your **vault name**, **tenant ID**, **client ID**, and **client secret**. Refer to the Azure documentation to [register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.
   - AWS Secrets Manager: provide your **access key ID**, **secret access key**, and **region**. The IAM user must have the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`, `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue`, and `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permissions.

     To give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user:

     |                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
     | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
     | `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>` | `<br>{<br>	"Version": "2012-10-17",<br>	"Statement": [<br>		{<br>			"Sid": "AccessAllSecrets",<br>			"Effect": "Allow",<br>			"Action": [<br>				"secretsmanager:ListSecrets",<br>				"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue",<br>				"secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy",<br>				"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",<br>				"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",<br>				"secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds",<br>			],<br>			"Resource": "*"<br>		}<br>	]<br>}<br>` |

     You can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` and `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values.

     Next, you need set the scope for the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets.

     For example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with `n8n` in your specified AWS account and region:

     |                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

     For more IAM permission policy examples, consult the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_iam-policies.html#auth-and-access_examples_batch).

   - HashiCorp Vault: provide the **Vault URL** for your vault instance, and select your **Authentication Method**. Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace.

     - Refer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method:
       [Token auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token)

       [AppRole auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle)

       [Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass)

     - If you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to [Vault Enterprise namespaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces.

   - Infisical: provide a **Service Token**. Refer to Infisical's [Service token](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/token) documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the **Site URL**.

     Infisical environment

     Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment.

     Infisical folders

     n8n doesn't support [Infisical folders](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/folder).

   - Google Cloud Platform: provide a **Service Account Key** (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` and `Secret Manager Secret Viewer`. Refer to Google's [service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) for more information.

4. **Save** your configuration.

5. Enable the provider using the **Disabled / Enabled** toggle.

## Use secrets in n8n credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#use-secrets-in-n8n-credentials "Permanent link")

To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:

1. Create a new credential, or open an existing one.
2. On the field where you want to use a secret:
3. Hover over the field.
4. Select **Expression**.
5. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an [expression](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#expression-n8n) referencing the secret name:

|             |                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }}<br>` |

`<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.

## Using external secrets with n8n environments [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#using-external-secrets-with-n8n-environments "Permanent link")

n8n's [Source control and environments](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.

For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.

## Using external secrets in projects [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#using-external-secrets-in-projects "Permanent link")

To use external secrets in an [RBAC project](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.

## Troubleshooting [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

### Infisical version changes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#infisical-version-changes "Permanent link")

Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.

### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#only-set-external-secrets-on-credentials-owned-by-an-instance-owner-or-admin "Permanent link")

Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.

Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production.

## n8n Deployment Guide

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/deployment/#deployment)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/deployment.md "Edit this page")

# Deployment [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/deployment/#deployment "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

See the [hosting documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/server-setup.html) for detailed setup options.

## User data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/deployment/#user-data "Permanent link")

n8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using [Rook](https://rook.io/) and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data.

Due to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud).

## Backups [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/deployment/#backups "Permanent link")

n8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server.

## Restarting [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/deployment/#restarting "Permanent link")

If your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data.

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/executions/index.md "Edit this page")

# Executions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/#executions "Permanent link")

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

## Execution modes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/#execution-modes "Permanent link")

There are two execution modes:

- Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Test Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
- Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.

## Execution lists [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/#execution-lists "Permanent link")

n8n provides two execution lists:

- [Workflow-level executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
- [All executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

## Workflow History Management

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/history/#workflow-history)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/history.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow history [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/history/#workflow-history "Permanent link")

Feature availability

- Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
- Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
- Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

## Understand workflow history [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/history/#understand-workflow-history "Permanent link")

n8n creates a new version when you:

- Save your workflow.
- Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
- Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/history/#view-workflow-history "Permanent link")

To view a workflow's history:

1. Open the workflow.
2. Select **Workflow history**![Workflow history icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/workflow-history.png). n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/history/#restore-or-copy-previous-versions "Permanent link")

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options**![Options icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png).
2. Choose what you want to do:
   - **Restore this version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
   - **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.

## n8n Embed Configuration

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#configuration)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/configuration.md "Edit this page")

# Configuration [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#configuration "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

## Authentication [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#authentication "Permanent link")

You can secure n8n by setting up [User management](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/), n8n's built-in authentication feature.

n8n supports [LDAP](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/ldap/) and [SAML](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/saml/).

### Credential overwrites [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites "Permanent link")

To offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.

In the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using OAuth by pressing the "connect" button on the credentials.

n8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.

#### Using environment variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#using-environment-variables "Permanent link")

You can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.

Warning

Even though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.

#### Using REST APIs [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#using-rest-apis "Permanent link")

The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.

Note

The endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.

For example:

1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:

|             |                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials<br>` |

2. A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:

|                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>` | `<br>{<br>    "asanaOAuth2Api": {<br>        "clientId": "<id>",<br>        "clientSecret": "<secret>"<br>    },<br>    "githubOAuth2Api": {<br>        "clientId": "<id>",<br>        "clientSecret": "<secret>"<br>    }<br>}<br>` |

3. Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:

|             |                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials<br>` |

Note

There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`.
In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials ( `googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials ( `googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.

## Environment variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#environment-variables "Permanent link")

n8n has many [environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:

| Variable                          | Type             | Default              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT`              | Number           | `-1`                 | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable.                                             |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE`           | Boolean          | `true`               | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number           | `10000`              | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `NODES_EXCLUDE`                   | Array of strings | -                    | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"`                                                                            |
| `NODES_INCLUDE`                   | Array of strings | -                    | Specify which nodes to load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED`           | Boolean          | `true`               | Enable [workflow templates](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#template-n8n) (true) or disable (false).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST`              | String           | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/templates/) for more information. |

## Backend hooks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#backend-hooks "Permanent link")

It's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.

### Available hooks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#available-hooks "Permanent link")

### Registering hooks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#registering-hooks "Permanent link")

Set hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions.
To register a hook, set the environment variable `EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES`.

You can set the variable to a single file:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js`

Or to contain multiple files separated by a semicolon:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js;/data/hook2.js`

### Backend hook files [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#backend-hook-files "Permanent link")

Hook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:

|                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Backend hook functions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#backend-hook-functions "Permanent link")

A hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.

If the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.

You can also access the database in any hook function using `this.dbCollections` (refer to the code sample in [Backend hook files](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#backend-hook-files).

## Frontend external hooks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#frontend-external-hooks "Permanent link")

Like backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.

### Available hooks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#available-hooks_1 "Permanent link")

### Registering hooks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#registering-hooks_1 "Permanent link")

You can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your `editor-ui/public/index.html` file:

|             |                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br><script src="frontend-hooks.js"></script><br>` |

### Frontend hook files [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#frontend-hook-files "Permanent link")

Frontend external hook files are regular JavaScript files which have the following format:

|                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Frontend hook functions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#frontend-hook-functions "Permanent link")

You can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:

- `store`: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.
- `metadata`: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the `editor-ui` package.

## n8n Expressions Guide

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/#expressions)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/expressions.md "Edit this page")

# Expressions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/#expressions "Permanent link")

Expressions are a powerful feature implemented in all n8n nodes. They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from:

- Previous node executions
- The workflow
- Your n8n environment

You can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code.

n8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament), and extends it with [custom methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) and [data transformation functions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/). These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata.

n8n additionally supports two libraries:

- [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/), for working with dates and time.
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), for querying JSON.

Data in n8n

When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.

## Writing expressions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/#writing-expressions "Permanent link")

To use an expression to set a parameter value:

1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
2. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.
3. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor**![Open expressions editor icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.

### Example: Get data from webhook body [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/#example-get-data-from-webhook-body "Permanent link")

Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.

Your webhook data looks similar to this:

|                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>` | `<br>[<br>  {<br>    "headers": {<br>      "host": "n8n.instance.address",<br>      ...<br>    },<br>    "params": {},<br>    "query": {},<br>    "body": {<br>      "name": "Jim",<br>      "age": 30,<br>      "city": "New York"<br>    }<br>  }<br>]<br>` |

In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:

|             |                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{$json.body.city}}<br>` |

This expression:

1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.
2. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, "New York"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.

### Example: Writing longer JavaScript [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/#example-writing-longer-javascript "Permanent link")

An expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.

To understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression.

However, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression:

|                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>` | `<br>// This example is split over multiple lines for readability<br>// It's still invalid when formatted as a single line<br>{{<br>  function example() {<br>    let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');<br>    let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');<br>    let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');<br>    return diffInMonths.toObject();<br>  }<br>  example();<br>}}<br>` |

While the second example is valid:

|             |                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months').toObject()}}<br>` |

2. Enter a **Key** and **Value**. The maximum key length is 50 characters, and the maximum value length is 220 characters. n8n limits the characters you can use in the key and value to lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores ( `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
3. Select **Save**. The variable is now available for use in all workflows in the n8n instance.

## Edit and delete variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/variables/#edit-and-delete-variables "Permanent link")

To edit or delete a variable:

1. On the **Variables** page, hover over the variable you want to change.
2. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.

## Use variables in workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/variables/#use-variables-in-workflows "Permanent link")

You can access variables in the Code node and in [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#expression-n8n):

|                  |                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>` | `<br>// Access a variable<br>$vars.<variable-name><br>` |

All variables are strings.

During workflow execution, n8n replaces the variables with the variable value. If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as `undefined`. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.

Variables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use [Workflow static data](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/).

# Release notes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#release-notes "Permanent link")

New features and bug fixes for n8n.

You can also view the [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) in the GitHub repository.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.86.1

Current `next`: 1.88.0

## How to update n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#how-to-update-n8n "Permanent link")

The steps to update your n8n depend on which n8n platform you use. Refer to the documentation for your n8n:

Next version

This is the `next` version. n8n recommends using the `latest` version. The `next` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

This release contains new features, new nodes, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#model-context-protocol-mcp-nodes "Permanent link")

MCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system.

While it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker.

We are adding two new nodes:

- a MCP [Server Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/) for any workflow
- a MCP [Client Tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) for the AI Agent

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface.

Max from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started:

[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/45WPU7P-1QQ?feature=shared)

### MCP Server Trigger [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#mcp-server-trigger "Permanent link")

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.

[![MCP Server Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/release-notes/MCP-Server-Trigger.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/release-notes/MCP-Server-Trigger.png) MCP Server Trigger

[Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/)

### MCP Client Tool [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#mcp-client-tool "Permanent link")

The MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.

### Folders [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#folders "Permanent link")

What can we say about folders? Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.

**How to use it:**

Create and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.

[![Folders](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/release-notes/Folders.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/release-notes/Folders.png) It's a folder alright

Folders are available for all [registered](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.

### Enhancements to Form Trigger Node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#enhancements-to-form-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Recent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.

- **HTML customization:** Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.
- **Custom CSS support**: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.
- **Form previews:** Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.
- **Hidden fields:** Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.
- **New responses options:** Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.

[![Form with custom CSS applied](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/release-notes/Forms_with_custom_CSS_and_HTML.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/release-notes/Forms_with_custom_CSS_and_HTML.png) Form with custom CSS applied

These improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.

### Schema Preview [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#schema-preview "Permanent link")

Schema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.

- **See expected node outputs instantly.** View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.
- **Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later.** Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.
- **Avoid unwanted executions when building.** Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.

**How to use it:**

- Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.
- Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.
- Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.

Don’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.

### Tidy up [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#tidy-up "Permanent link")

Tidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows. Whether you're preparing to share a workflow or just want to improve readability, this feature saves you time and makes your logic easier to follow. Clean, well-organized workflows aren't just nicer to look at—they’re also quicker to understand.

**How to:**

Open the workflow you want to tidy, then choose one of these options:

- Click the **Tidy up** button in the bottom-left corner of the canvas (it looks like a broom 🧹)
- Press **Shift + Alt + T** on your keyboard
- Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select **Tidy up workflow**

Want to tidy up just part of your workflow? Select the specific nodes you want to clean up first - Tidy up will only adjust those, along with any stickies behind them.

### Multiple API keys [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#multiple-api-keys "Permanent link")

n8n now supports multiple API keys, allowing users to generate and manage separate keys for different workflows or integrations. This improves security by enabling easier key rotation and isolation of credentials. Future updates will introduce more granular controls.

### Improved partial executions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#improved-partial-executions "Permanent link")

The new execution engine for partial executions ensures that testing parts of a workflow in the builder closely mirrors production behaviour. This makes iterating with updated run-data faster and more reliable, particularly for complex workflows.

Before, user would test parts of a workflow in the builder that didn't consistently reflect production behaviour, leading to unexpected results during development.

This update aligns workflow execution in the builder with production behavior.

Here is an example for loops:

Before

After

### Improved consistency across environments [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#improved-consistency-across-environments "Permanent link")

We added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances.

Previously, users faced issues like:

- Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes
- Incomplete synchronization, where changes — such as deletions — weren’t always applied across environments
- Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled

We addressed these by:

- Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes
- Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments
- Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what’s being pushed

### Overhauled Code node editing experience [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#overhauled-code-node-editing-experience "Permanent link")

We added a ton of new helpers to the Code node, making edits of your code much faster and more comfortable. You get:

- TypeScript autocomplete
- TypeScript linting
- TypeScript hover tips
- Search and replace
- New keyboard shortcuts based on the VSCode keymap
- Auto-formatting using prettier (Alt+Shift+F)
- Remember folded regions and history after refresh
- Multi cursor
- Type function in the Code node using JSDoc types
- Drag and drop for all Code node modes
- Indentation markers

We build this on a web worker architecture so you won't have to suffer from performance degradation while typing.

To get the full picture, check out our Studio update with Max and Elias, where they discuss and demo the new editing experience. 👇

### Task runners for the Code node in public beta [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#task-runners-for-the-code-node-in-public-beta "Permanent link")

We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.

[![Task runners overview](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png) Task runners overview

Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.

The Task runner comes in two modes:

- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes
- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.

To start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/).

### Node updates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#node-updates_4 "Permanent link")

- [AI Transform node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data
- [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped

This release contains a new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

### New node: n8n Form [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#new-node-n8n-form "Permanent link")

Use the [n8n Form node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

[![A multi-page form with branching](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/example_image.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/example_image.png) A multi-page form with branching

Additionally you can:

- Set default selections with query parameters
- Define the form with a JSON array of objects
- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL

### Node updates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#node-updates_7 "Permanent link")

New nodes:

- [Google Business Profile](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows

Enhanced nodes:

- [AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool
- [GitHub](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation
- [Structured Output Parser](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages

For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.

For better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.

This release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#enhanced-node-remove-duplicates "Permanent link")

The [Remove Duplicates node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:

- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates
- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.

### New node: Gong [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#new-node-gong "Permanent link")

The new node for [Gong](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

**Release date:** 2024-10-09

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

What changed?

- The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.
- The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.

When is action necessary?

- If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.
- If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

**Release date:** 2024-10-02

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

Skipped 1.62.0

We skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.

#### Additional nodes as tools [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#additional-nodes-as-tools "Permanent link")

We have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

Additionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.

Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.

### Node updates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#node-updates_9 "Permanent link")

- [Google BigQuery](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebigquery/): Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings

- [Question and Answer Chain](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): Added the option to use a custom prompt

Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.

Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

Breaking change

Calling `$(...).last()` (or `(...).first()` or `$(...).all()`) without arguments now returns the last item (or first or all items) of the output that connects two nodes. Previously, it returned the item/items of the first output of that node. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1470) for details.

This release contains bug fixes, feature enhancements, a new node, node enhancements and performance improvements.

Backup recommended

Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.

Credential sharing required for manual executions

Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.

#### New feature: Projects [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#new-feature-projects "Permanent link")

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.

Refer to the [RBAC](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.

The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.

#### New node: Slack Trigger [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#new-node-slack-trigger "Permanent link")

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.

### Other highlights [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#other-highlights "Permanent link")

- Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/).

### Rolling back to a previous version [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#rolling-back-to-a-previous-version "Permanent link")

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

Self-hosted n8n:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
2. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

Cloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

Breaking change

Please note that this version contains a breaking change for instances using a Postgres database. The default value for the DB_POSTGRESDB_USER environment variable was switched from `root` to `postgres`. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1400) for details.

This release contains new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#new-feature-ask-ai-in-the-http-node "Permanent link")

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
2. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
3. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/)

#### New nodes and improved experience for working with files [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/#new-nodes-and-improved-experience-for-working-with-files "Permanent link")

This release includes a major overhaul of nodes relating to files (binary data).

There are now three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) and [XML](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

## n8n Embed Prerequisites

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/#prerequisites)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/prerequisites.md "Edit this page")

# Prerequisites [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

The requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.

| Component | Sizing                                   | Supported                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| CPU/vCPU  | Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed | Any public or private cloud |
| Database  | 512 MB - 4 GB SSD                        | SQLite or PostgreSQL        |
| Memory    | 320 MB - 2 GB                            |                             |

## CPU considerations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/#cpu-considerations "Permanent link")

n8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.

## Database considerations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/#database-considerations "Permanent link")

n8n uses its database to store [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n), past executions, and workflows.

A core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.

n8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.

For Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.

### Best practices [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/#best-practices "Permanent link")

- SSD storage.
- In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.
- If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.
- Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.
- Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.

## Memory considerations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/prerequisites/#memory-considerations "Permanent link")

An n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.

For example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources.

## Function [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/code/#function "Permanent link")

A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript or Python code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.

The [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can create any function you want using JavaScript code.

## Splitting Workflows in n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/splitting/#splitting-workflows-with-conditional-nodes)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/splitting.md "Edit this page")

# Splitting workflows with conditional nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/splitting/#splitting-workflows-with-conditional-nodes "Permanent link")

Splitting uses the [IF](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.

Compare these workflows:

[!["Diagram representing two workflows. One has three steps and follows a linear process, with a user submitting a bug, and the workflow emailing a support team. The second workflow starts the same way, but then splits depending on whether the user marked the issue as urgent. It then splits again depending on the user's support plan"](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/splitting/single-multi-branch-workflow.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/splitting/single-multi-branch-workflow.png)

This is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.

Refer to the [IF](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) documentation for usage details.

## Custom API Operations

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#custom-api-operations)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/custom-operations.md "Edit this page")

# Custom API operations [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#custom-api-operations "Permanent link")

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

- Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
- Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

## Predefined credential types [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types "Permanent link")

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#using-predefined-credential-types "Permanent link")

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
2. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
3. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
4. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
5. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
6. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

### Credential scopes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#credential-scopes "Permanent link")

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

## n8n CLI Commands

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#cli-commands-for-n8n)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/cli-commands.md "Edit this page")

# CLI commands for n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#cli-commands-for-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n includes a CLI (command line interface), allowing you to perform actions using the CLI rather than the n8n editor. These include starting workflows, and exporting and importing workflows and credentials.

## Running CLI commands [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#running-cli-commands "Permanent link")

You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:

- npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.
- Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:

|             |                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command><br>` |

## Start a workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#start-a-workflow "Permanent link")

You can start workflows directly using the CLI.

Execute a saved workflow by its ID:

|             |                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n execute --id <ID><br>` |

## Change the active status of a workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#change-the-active-status-of-a-workflow "Permanent link")

You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.

Restart required

These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:

|             |                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=false<br>` |

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:

|             |                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=true<br>` |

Set the active status to false for all the workflows:

|             |                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n update:workflow --all --active=false<br>` |

Set the active status to true for all the workflows:

|             |                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n update:workflow --all --active=true<br>` |

## Export workflows and credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials "Permanent link")

You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Command flags:

| Flag        | Description                                                                                 |

| --all       | Exports all workflows/credentials.                                                          |
| --backup    | Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output.                |
| --id        | The ID of the workflow to export.                                                           |
| --output    | Outputs file name or directory if using separate files.                                     |
| --pretty    | Formats the output in an easier to read fashion.                                            |
| --separate  | Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output. |
| --decrypted | Exports the credentials in a plain text format.                                             |

### Workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#workflows "Permanent link")

Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):

|             |                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n export:workflow --all<br>` |

Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:

|             |                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n export:workflow --id=<ID> --output=file.json<br>` |

Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:

|             |                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n export:credentials --backup --output=backups/latest/<br>` |

Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.

Sensitive information

All sensitive information is visible in the files.

|             |                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n export:credentials --all --decrypted --output=backups/decrypted.json<br>` |

## Import workflows and credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials "Permanent link")

You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Update the IDs

When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.

Available flags:

| Flag        | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --help      | Help prompt.                                                                               |
| --input     | Input file name or directory if you use --separate.                                        |
| --projectId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with `--userId`. |
| --separate  | Imports `*.json` files from directory provided by --input.                                 |
| --userId    | Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with `--projectId`. |

Migrating to SQLite

n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.

This might result in errors like **Data too long for column name** during the import process.

In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.

### Workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#workflows_1 "Permanent link")

Import workflows from a specific file:

|             |                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n import:workflow --input=file.json<br>` |

Import all the workflow files as JSON from the specified directory:

|             |                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n import:workflow --separate --input=backups/latest/<br>` |

### Credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#credentials_1 "Permanent link")

Import credentials from a specific file:

|             |                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n import:credentials --input=file.json<br>` |

Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:

|             |                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n import:credentials --separate --input=backups/latest/<br>` |

## License [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#license "Permanent link")

### Clear [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#clear "Permanent link")

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:

| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n license:clear<br>` |

If your license includes [floating entitlements](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#entitlement-n8n), running this command will also attempt to release them back to the pool, making them available for other instances.

### Info [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#info "Permanent link")

Display information about the existing license:

|             |                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n license:info<br>` |

## User management [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#user-management "Permanent link")

You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.

Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.

|             |                                     |

### Disable MFA for a user [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#disable-mfa-for-a-user "Permanent link")

If a user loses their recovery codes you can disable MFA for a user with this command. The user will then be able to log back in to set up MFA again.

|             |                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n mfa:disable --email=johndoe@example.com<br>` |

### Disable LDAP [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#disable-ldap "Permanent link")

You can reset the LDAP settings using the command below.

|             |                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n ldap:reset<br>` |

## Security audit [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#security-audit "Permanent link")

You can run a [security audit](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/security-audit/) on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

|             |                     |

## Code Node Usage

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#using-the-code-node)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/code-node.md "Edit this page")

# Using the Code node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#using-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

Coding in n8n

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/code/) section. It includes:

- Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/)
- Guidance on [Handling dates](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/)
- A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/code-node/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.

Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

## Usage [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#usage "Permanent link")

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#choose-a-mode "Permanent link")

There are two modes:

- **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
- **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#javascript "Permanent link")

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#supported-javascript-features "Permanent link")

The Code node supports:

- Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
- Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#external-libraries "Permanent link")

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

- [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
- [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#built-in-methods-and-variables "Permanent link")

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#keyboard-shortcuts "Permanent link")

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#python "Permanent link")

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#built-in-methods-and-variables_1 "Permanent link")

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#keyboard-shortcuts_1 "Permanent link")

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#file-system-and-http-requests "Permanent link")

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

- [Read/Write File From Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
- [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Coding in n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#coding-in-n8n "Permanent link")

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#key-concepts "Permanent link")

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

- [Data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
- [Item linking](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#built-in-methods-and-variables_2 "Permanent link")

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

- Accessing specific item data
- Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
- Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/#use-ai-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
3. Write your query.
4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## Update self-hosted n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/updating/#update-self-hosted-n8n)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/updating.md "Edit this page")

# Update self-hosted n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/updating/#update-self-hosted-n8n "Permanent link")

It's important to keep your n8n version up to date. This ensures you get the latest features and fixes.

Some tips when updating:

- Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
- Check the [Release notes](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/) for breaking changes.
- Use [Environments](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.

For instructions on how to update, refer to the documentation for your installation method:

- [Installed with npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/)
- [Installed with Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/)

## Sub-workflows in n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/#sub-workflows)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/subworkflows.md "Edit this page")

# Sub-workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/#sub-workflows "Permanent link")

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/#set-up-and-use-a-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/#create-the-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

2. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
1. Select the **Options**![Options menu](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).
1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
   - **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
3. In the sub-workflow [settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/).
6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/#call-the-sub-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.
3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/#how-data-passes-between-workflows "Permanent link")

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

# npm [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#npm "Permanent link")

npm is a quick way to get started with n8n on your local machine. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. n8n requires Node.js 18 or above.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.86.1

Current `next`: 1.88.0

## Try n8n with npx [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#try-n8n-with-npx "Permanent link")

You can try n8n without installing it using npx.

From the terminal, run:

|             |                   |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>npx n8n<br>` |

This command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/).

## Install globally with npm [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#install-globally-with-npm "Permanent link")

To install n8n globally, use npm:

|             |                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>npm install n8n -g<br>` |

To install or update to a specific version of n8n use the `@` syntax to specify the version. For example:

|             |                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>npm install -g n8n@0.126.1<br>` |

To install `next`:

|             |                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>npm install -g n8n@next<br>` |

After the installation, start n8n by running:

|                       |                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>` | `<br>n8n<br># or<br>n8n start<br>` |

### Next steps [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#next-steps "Permanent link")

Try out n8n using the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/).

## Updating [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#updating "Permanent link")

To update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:

|             |                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>npm update -g n8n<br>` |

To install the `next` version:

|             |                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>npm install -g n8n@next<br>` |

## n8n with tunnel [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel "Permanent link")

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

|             |                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>n8n start --tunnel<br>` |

## Reverting an upgrade [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#reverting-an-upgrade "Permanent link")

Install the older version that you want to go back to.

If the upgrade involved a database migration:

1. Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
2. Run `n8n db:revert` on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.

## Windows troubleshooting [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#windows-troubleshooting "Permanent link")

If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

## Export and Import Workflows

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/#export-and-import-workflows)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/export-import.md "Edit this page")

# Export and import workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/#export-and-import-workflows "Permanent link")

n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library.
You can export and import workflows in several ways.

Sharing credentials

Exported workflow JSON files include [credential](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.

## Copy-Paste [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/#copy-paste "Permanent link")

You can copy and paste a workflow or parts of it by selecting the nodes you want to copy to the clipboard ( `Ctrl + c` or `cmd +c`) and pasting it ( `Ctrl + v` or `cmd + v`) into the Editor UI.

To select all nodes or a group of nodes, click and drag:
[![Select a group of nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/workflows/export-import/selectingnodes.gif)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/workflows/export-import/selectingnodes.gif)

## From the Editor UI menu [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/#from-the-editor-ui-menu "Permanent link")

From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right ![Workflow menu icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) to see the following options:

[![Import/Export menu](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-six/l1-c6-import-export-menu.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-six/l1-c6-import-export-menu.png) _Import & Export workflows menu_

- **Download**: Downloads your current workflow as a JSON file to your computer.
- **Import from URL**: Imports workflow JSON from a URL, for example, [this workflow JSON file on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/demo-setup/main/n8n/backup/workflows/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb.json).
- **Import from File**: Imports a workflow as a JSON file from your computer.

## From the command line [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/#from-the-command-line "Permanent link")

- Export: See the [full list of commands](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) for exporting workflows or credentials.
- Import: See the [full list of commands](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials) for importing workflows or credentials.

## n8n Workflow Templates

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/#workflow-templates)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/workflow-templates.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow templates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/#workflow-templates "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

n8n provides a library of workflow [templates](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#template-n8n). When embedding n8n, you can:

- Continue to use n8n's workflow templates library (this is the default behavior)
- Disable workflow templates
- Create your own workflow templates library

## Disable workflow templates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/#disable-workflow-templates "Permanent link")

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` to false.

## Use your own workflow templates library [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/#use-your-own-workflow-templates-library "Permanent link")

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` to the base URL of your API.

### Endpoints [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/#endpoints "Permanent link")

Your API must provide the same endpoints and data structure as n8n's.

# Scaling n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview/#scaling-n8n "Permanent link")

When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.

n8n can run in different [modes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) depending on your needs. The `queue` mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) for configuration details.

You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to [Execution data](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/execution-data/) for details.

## Workflow Waiting Logic

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/waiting/#waiting)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/waiting.md "Edit this page")

# Waiting [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/waiting/#waiting "Permanent link")

Waiting allows you to pause a workflow mid-execution, then resume where the workflow left off, with the same data. This is useful if you need to rate limit your calls to a service, or wait for an external event to complete. You can wait for a specified duration, or until a webhook fires.

Making a workflow wait uses the [Wait](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node. Refer to the node documentation for usage details.

n8n provides a workflow template with a basic example of [Rate limiting and waiting for external events](https://n8n.io/workflows/1749-rate-limiting-and-waiting-for-external-events/).

# Level one: Introduction [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#level-one-introduction "Permanent link")

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 1**!

## Is this course right for me? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#is-this-course-right-for-me "Permanent link")

This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts within n8n and develops your low-code automation expertise.

This course is for you if you:

- Are starting to use n8n for the first time.
- Are looking for some extra help creating your first workflow.
- Want to automate processes in your personal or working life.

This course introduces n8n concepts and demonstrates practical workflow building without assuming any prior familiarity with n8n. If you'd like to get a feel for the basics without as much explanation, consult our [quickstart guide](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow/).

## What will I learn in this course? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#what-will-i-learn-in-this-course "Permanent link")

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of n8n, followed by practice of building workflows step by step.

By the end of this course you will know:

- How to set up n8n and navigate the Editor UI.
- How n8n structures data.
- How to configure different node parameters and add credentials.
- When and how to use conditional logic in workflows.
- How to schedule and control workflows.
- How to import, download, and share workflows with others.

You will build two workflows:

- A two-node workflow to get articles from Hacker News
- A seven-node workflow to help your client get records from a data warehouse, filter them, make calculations, and notify team members about the results

## What do I need to get started? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#what-do-i-need-to-get-started "Permanent link")

1. **n8n set up**: You can use [n8n Cloud](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/overview/) (or the [self-hosted version](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) if you have experience hosting services).
2. **A course user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI) to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and [APIs](https://n8n.io/blog/what-are-apis-how-to-use-them-with-no-code/) would be helpful, but isn't necessary.
4. An [account on the n8n community forum](https://community.n8n.io/) if you wish to receive a profile badge and avatar upon successful completion.

## How long does the course take? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#how-long-does-the-course-take "Permanent link")

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#how-do-i-complete-the-course "Permanent link")

# Securing n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/overview/#securing-n8n "Permanent link")

Securing your n8n instance can take several forms.

At a high level, you can:

- Conduct a [security audit](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/security-audit/) to identify security risks.
- [Set up SSL](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/set-up-ssl/) to enforce secure connections.
- [Set up Single Sign-On](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/set-up-sso/) for user account management.
- Use [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/two-factor-auth/) for your users.

More granularly, consider blocking or opting out of features or data collection you don't want:

- [Disable the public API](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/disable-public-api/) if you aren't using it.
- [Opt out of data collection](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/telemetry-opt-out/) of the anonymous data n8n collects automatically.
- [Block certain nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) from being available to your users.

## n8n Cloud Concurrency

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/#cloud-concurrency)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/manage-cloud/concurrency.md "Edit this page")

# Cloud concurrency [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/#cloud-concurrency "Permanent link")

Only for n8n Cloud

This document discusses concurrency in n8n Cloud. Read [self-hosted n8n concurrency control](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/concurrency-control/) to learn how concurrency works with self-hosted n8n instances.

Too many concurrent executions can cause performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode.

Any executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

## Concurrency limits [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/#concurrency-limits "Permanent link")

n8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan:

- Starter and Trial: 5
- Pro (10k workflow executions, 15 active workflows): 20
- Pro (50k workflow executions, 50 active workflows): 50
- Enterprise (in regular mode): 200

You can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Details [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/#details "Permanent link")

Some other details about concurrency to keep in mind:

- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.
- [Test evaluations](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#evaluation-n8n) do not count towards concurrency limits. Your test evaluation concurrency limit is equal to, but separate from, your plan's regular concurrency limit.
- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.

## Comparison to queue mode [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/#comparison-to-queue-mode "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Queue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

Concurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance.

## Query JSON with JMESPath

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#query-json-with-jmespath)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/jmespath.md "Edit this page")

# Query JSON with JMESPath [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#query-json-with-jmespath "Permanent link")

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

## The `jmespath()` method [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#the-jmespath-method "Permanent link")

n8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.

The basic syntax is:

[JavaScript](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#__tabbed_1_1)[Python](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#__tabbed_1_2)

|             |                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>$jmespath(object, searchString)<br>` |

|             |                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>_jmespath(object, searchString)<br>` |

To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:

|                  |                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>` | `<br>var jmespath = require('jmespath');<br>jmespath.search(object, searchString);<br>` |

Expressions must be single-line

The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.

`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) provide interactive examples.

Search parameter order

The examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/), which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.

## Common tasks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#common-tasks "Permanent link")

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.

### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/#apply-a-jmespath-expression-to-a-collection-of-elements-with-projections "Permanent link")

From the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections):

> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
>
> - List Projections
> - Slice Projections
> - Object Projections
> - Flatten Projections
> - Filter Projections

The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections) for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

# Sustainable Use License [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

Proprietary licenses for Enterprise

Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. [Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.

n8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

## License FAQs [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#license-faqs "Permanent link")

### What license do you use? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-license-do-you-use "Permanent link")

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-source-code-is-covered-by-the-sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:

- Content of branches other than master.
- Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md).

### What is the Sustainable Use License? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-is-the-sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

- You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
- You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
- You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product "Permanent link")

Our license restricts use to "internal business purposes". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

- White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.
- Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license:

- Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.
- Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.
- Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.
- Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.

#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#can-i-use-n8n-to-act-as-the-back-end-to-power-a-feature-in-my-app "Permanent link")

Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.

Here are two examples to clarify:

##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#example-1-sync-acme-app-with-hubspot "Permanent link")

Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.

**NOT ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.

##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#example-2-embed-ai-chatbot-in-acme-app "Permanent link")

Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.

**ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.

### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-if-i-want-to-use-n8n-for-something-thats-not-permitted-by-the-license "Permanent link")

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed).

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why don't you use an open source license? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#why-dont-you-use-an-open-source-license "Permanent link")

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#why-did-you-create-a-license "Permanent link")

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
2. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

1. To be as permissive as possible.
2. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
3. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#my-company-has-a-policy-against-using-code-that-restricts-commercial-use-can-i-still-use-n8n "Permanent link")

Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-happens-to-the-code-i-contribute-to-n8n-in-light-of-the-sustainable-use-license "Permanent link")

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).

### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#why-did-you-switch-to-the-sustainable-use-license-from-your-previous-license-arrangement-apache-20-with-commons-clause "Permanent link")

n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-are-the-main-differences-between-the-sustainable-use-license-and-your-previous-license-arrangement-apache-20-with-commons-clause "Permanent link")

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to "sell" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is n8n open source? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#is-n8n-open-source "Permanent link")

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#what-is-fair-code-and-how-does-the-sustainable-use-license-relate-to-it "Permanent link")

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

- Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
- Has its source code openly available.
- Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
- Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/#can-i-use-n8ns-sustainable-use-license-for-my-own-project "Permanent link")

Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

# Nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#nodes "Permanent link")

[Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#node-n8n) are the key building blocks of a [workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#workflow-n8n). They perform a range of actions, including:

- Starting the workflow.
- Fetching and sending data.
- Processing and manipulating data.

n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

- [Built-in integrations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
- [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
- [Creating nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.

## Add a node to your workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#add-a-node-to-your-workflow "Permanent link")

### Add a node to an empty workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#add-a-node-to-an-empty-workflow "Permanent link")

1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#trigger-node-n8n).
2. Select the trigger you want to use.

Choose the correct app event

If you select **On App Event**, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.

For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

[![Screenshot of the Asana node operations list, showing the Recommended section at the top of the list](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/workflows/components/nodes/recommended-trigger.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/workflows/components/nodes/recommended-trigger.png)

### Add a node to an existing workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#add-a-node-to-an-existing-workflow "Permanent link")

Select the **Add node**![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#node-operations-triggers-and-actions "Permanent link")

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

- Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/trigger.png).
- Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Node controls [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls "Permanent link")

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

- **Test step**![Test step icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/play-node.png): Run the node.
- **Deactivate**![Deactivate node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/power-off.png): Deactivate the node.
- **Delete**![Delete node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/delete-node.png): Delete the node.
- **Node context menu**![Node context menu icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png): Select node actions. Available actions:
  - Open node
  - Test step
  - Rename node
  - Deactivate node
  - Pin node
  - Copy node
  - Duplicate node
  - Select all
  - Clear selection
  - Delete node

## Node settings [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#node-settings "Permanent link")

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

- **Request Options**: Select **Add Option** to view and select these options.
  - **Batching**: Control how to batch large numbers of input items.
  - **Ignore SSL Issues**: Download the response even if SSL validation isn't possible.
  - **Proxy**: Use this if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
  - **Timeout**: Set a timeout for the request in ms.
- **Always Output Data**: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
- **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
- **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.
- **On Error**:
  - **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
  - **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
  - **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.

You can document your workflow using node notes:

- **Notes**: Note to save with the node.
- **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-structure.md "Edit this page")

# Data structure [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/#data-structure "Permanent link")

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. It has the following structure:

|                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>` | `<br>[<br>	{<br>		// For most data:<br>		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json'<br>		"json": {<br>			// Example data<br>			"apple": "beets",<br>			"carrot": {<br>				"dill": 1<br>			}<br>		},<br>		// For binary data:<br>		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary'<br>		"binary": {<br>			// Example data<br>			"apple-picture": {<br>				"data": "....", // Base64 encoded binary data (required)<br>				"mimeType": "image/png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)<br>				"fileExtension": "png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)<br>				"fileName": "example.png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)<br>			}<br>		}<br>	},<br>]<br>` |

Skipping the `json` key and array syntax

From 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the `json` key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array ( `[]`) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the `json` key.

## Data item processing [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/#data-item-processing "Permanent link")

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

|                                                |                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>` | `<br>[<br>	{<br>		name-input-value: "test1"<br>	},<br>	{<br>		name-input-value: "test2"<br>	}<br>]<br>` |

## Date and Time with Luxon

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#date-and-time-with-luxon)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/luxon.md "Edit this page")

# Date and time with Luxon [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#date-and-time-with-luxon "Permanent link")

[Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.

Python support

Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience [variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#variables) created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:

- You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.
- The generic Luxon functionality, such as [Convert date string to Luxon](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#convert-date-string-to-luxon), isn't available for Python users.

## Variables [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#variables "Permanent link")

n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:

- `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.
- `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.

Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's `DateTime.now()`.

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions \| Dates](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

## Date and time behavior in n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#date-and-time-behavior-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Be aware of the following:

- In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.
- With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

## Setting the timezone in n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#setting-the-timezone-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:

- Default: `America/New York`
- A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.
- A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.

## Common tasks [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#common-tasks "Permanent link")

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

### Convert date string to Luxon [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#convert-date-string-to-luxon "Permanent link")

You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.

A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date

With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format: [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#if-you-have-a-date-in-a-supported-standard-technical-format "Permanent link")

Most dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_2_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_2_2)

|             |                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}<br>` |

|             |                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')<br>` |

Luxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso).

Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.

#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format: [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#if-you-have-a-date-as-a-string-that-doesnt-use-a-standard-format "Permanent link")

Use Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.

For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_3_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_3_2)

|             |                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")}}<br>` |

|             |                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")<br>` |

When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations). If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging) guide.

### Get n days from today [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#get-n-days-from-today "Permanent link")

Get a number of days before or after today.

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_4_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_4_2)

For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.

In the expressions editor, enter:

|             |                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}<br>` |

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.

In the code editor, enter:

|             |                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})<br>` |

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For more detailed information and examples, refer to:

- Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)
- Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)

### Create human-readable dates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#create-human-readable-dates "Permanent link")

In [Get n days from today](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#get-n-days-from-today), the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: "yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00"]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.

For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.

This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_5_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_5_2)

|             |                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}<br>` |

|             |                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()<br>` |

You can alter the format. For example:

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_6_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_6_2)

|             |                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}<br>` |

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".

|             |                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})<br>` |

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".

Refer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans) for more information.

### Get the time between two dates [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#get-the-time-between-two-dates "Permanent link")

To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.

For example, get the number of months between two dates:

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_7_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_7_2)

|             |                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}<br>` |

This returns `[Object: {"months":1}]`.

|             |                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()<br>` |

This returns `{"months":1}`.

Refer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs) for more information.

### A longer example: How many days to Christmas? [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#a-longer-example-how-many-days-to-christmas "Permanent link")

This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.

The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.

[Expressions (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_8_1)[Code node (JavaScript)](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#__tabbed_8_2)

|             |                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>{{"There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!"}}<br>` |

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the expression does:

- `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.
- `"There are "`: a string.
- `+`: used to join two strings.
- `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
- `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
- `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {"days":-291}]`.
- `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
- `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
- `+ " days to Christmas!"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.
- `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.

|             |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>let daysToChristmas = "There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!";<br>` |

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the code does:

- `"There are "`: a string.
- `+`: used to join two strings.
- `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.

# Workflow management in Embed [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#workflow-management-in-embed "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

When managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:

| Solution                                                              | Pros                                                               | Cons                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create a workflow for each user                                       | No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger)         | Requires managing multiple workflows.          |
| Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing | Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). | To run the workflow, your product must call it |

Warning

The APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade.

## Workflow per user [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#workflow-per-user "Permanent link")

There are three general steps to follow:

- Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow.
- Create the [n8n credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) for this user.
- Create the workflow.

### 1\. Obtain user credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#1-obtain-user-credentials "Permanent link")

Here you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.

### 2\. Create user credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#2-create-user-credentials "Permanent link")

After all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#using-the-editor-ui "Permanent link")

1. From the menu select **Credentials** \> **New**.
2. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example _Airtable_.

3. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.
   [![Create New Credentials modal](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials2.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials2.png)
4. Click **Create** to finish and save.

#### Using the API [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#using-the-api "Permanent link")

The frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.

For example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:

|             |                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials<br>` |

With the request body:

|                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>` | `<br>{<br>   "name":"MyAirtable",<br>   "type":"airtableApi",<br>   "nodesAccess":[<br>      {<br>         "nodeType":"n8n-nodes-base.airtable"<br>      }<br>   ],<br>   "data":{<br>      "apiKey":"q12we34r5t67yu"<br>   }<br>}<br>` |

The response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:

|                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### 3\. Create the workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#3-create-the-workflow "Permanent link")

Best practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).

You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#using-the-editor-ui_1 "Permanent link")

1. From the menu select **Workflows** \> **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.

2. Select **Workflows** \> **Duplicate**, then enter a name for this new workflow and click **Save**.
   [![Duplicate workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/managing-workflows/duplicate_workflow.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/managing-workflows/duplicate_workflow.png)

3. Update all relevant nodes to use the credentials for this user (created above).

4. **Save** this workflow set it to **Active** using the toggle in the top-right corner.

#### Using the API [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#using-the-api_1 "Permanent link")

1. Fetch the JSON of the template workflow using the endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<workflow_id>`

|             |                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>GET https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012<br>` |

The response will contain the JSON data of the selected workflow:

|

|             |                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<br>` |

The response will contain the ID of the new workflow, which you will use in the next step.

1. Lastly, activate the new workflow:

|             |                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>` | `<br>PATCH https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012<br>` |

Passing the additional value `active` in your JSON payload:

|                                 |                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>` | `<br>// ...<br>"active":true,<br>"settings": {},<br>"staticData": null,<br>"tags": []<br>` |

## Single workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#single-workflow "Permanent link")

There are four steps to follow to implement this method:

- Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow. See [Obtain user credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#1-obtain-user-credentials) above.
- Create the n8n credentials for this user. See [Create user credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#2-create-user-credentials) above.
- Create the workflow.
- Call the workflow as needed.

### Create the workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#create-the-workflow "Permanent link")

The details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind:

- This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.
- The incoming webhook call must contain the user’s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.
- Each node where the user’s credentials are needed should use an [expression](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/) so that the node’s credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.
- Save and activate the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to [webhook node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) for more information.

### Call the workflow [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/managing-workflows/#call-the-workflow "Permanent link")

For each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters).

## Data Pinning Guide

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/#data-pinning)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-pinning.md "Edit this page")

# Data pinning [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/#data-pinning "Permanent link")

You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions.

You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:

- If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
- If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
- You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.

You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output ("error" outputs don't count for this purpose).

For development only

Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Pin data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/#pin-data "Permanent link")

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data**![Pin data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png). When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Unpin data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/#unpin-data "Permanent link")

When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the **Unpin** link in the banner.

## Debug Past Executions

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/#debug-and-re-run-past-executions)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/executions/debug.md "Edit this page")

# Debug and re-run past executions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/#debug-and-re-run-past-executions "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.

## Load data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/#load-data "Permanent link")

To load data from a previous execution:

1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.
2. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
   - For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.
   - For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.
3. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.

Check which executions you save

The executions available on the **Executions** list depends on your [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).

## Schema Preview

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/schema-preview/#schema-preview)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/schema-preview.md "Edit this page")

# Schema Preview [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/schema-preview/#schema-preview "Permanent link")

Schema Preview exposes expected schema data from the previous node in the Node Editor without the user having to provide credentials or execute the node. This makes it possible to construct workflows without having to provide credentials in advance. The preview doesn't include mock data, but it does expose the expected fields, making it possible to select and incorporate them into the input of subsequent nodes.

## Using the preview [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/schema-preview/#using-the-preview "Permanent link")

1. There must be a node with Schema Preview available in your workflow.
2. When clicking on the details of the next node in the sequence, the Schema Preview data will show up in the Node Editor where schema data would typically be exposed.
3. Use data from the Schema Preview just as you would other schemas - drag and drop fields as input into your node parameters and settings.

## Data Mocking Techniques

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mocking/#data-mocking)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mocking.md "Edit this page")

# Data mocking [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mocking/#data-mocking "Permanent link")

Data mocking is simulating or faking data. It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:

- Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.
- Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.
- Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.

## Mocking with real data using data pinning [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mocking/#mocking-with-real-data-using-data-pinning "Permanent link")

Using [data pinning](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/).

Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data**![Pin data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png). When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mocking/#generate-custom-data-using-the-code-or-edit-fields-nodes "Permanent link")

You can create a custom dataset in your workflow using either the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) or the [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/).

In the Code node, you can create any data set you want, and return it as the node output. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add fields** to add your custom data.

The Edit Fields node is a good choice for small tests. To create more complex datasets, use the Code node.

## Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mocking/#output-a-sample-data-set-from-the-customer-datastore-node "Permanent link")

The Customer Datastore node provides a fake dataset to work with. Add and execute the node to explore the data.

Use this approach if you need some test data when exploring n8n, and you don't have a real use-case to work with.

## AI Coding with n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#ai-coding-with-gpt)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/ai-code.md "Edit this page")

# AI coding with GPT [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#ai-coding-with-gpt "Permanent link")

Not available on self-hosted.

Python isn't supported.
///

## Use AI in the Code node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#use-ai-in-the-code-node "Permanent link")

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
3. Write your query.
4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## Usage limits [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#usage-limits "Permanent link")

During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.

## Feature limits [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#feature-limits "Permanent link")

The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:

- The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.
- The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.
- Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.
- Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.
- May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.

## Writing good prompts [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#writing-good-prompts "Permanent link")

Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.

Some general tips:

- Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.
- Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: "First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name."
- Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying "Get the older users," you might say "Filter users who are 60 years and above."
- Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.

And some n8n-specific guidance:

- Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.
- Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. "Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: "Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node."
- Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.

### Example prompts [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#example-prompts "Permanent link")

These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.

#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#example-1-find-a-piece-of-data-inside-a-second-dataset "Permanent link")

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the third Code node, enter this prompt:

> The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

### Reference incoming node data explicitly [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/code/ai-code/#reference-incoming-node-data-explicitly "Permanent link")

If your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.

[!["Screenshot of an n8n code node, highlighting how to reference data with dot notation in an AI query"](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/code/ai-code/reference-data-dot-notation.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/code/ai-code/reference-data-dot-notation.png)

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_workflows/ai-code/reference-incoming-data-explicitly.json) and import it into n8n.

In the second Code node, enter this prompt:

> The data in "Mock data" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal_info.first_name and work_info.job_title.

## Binary Data Management

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/#binary-data)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/binary-data.md "Edit this page")

# Binary data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/#binary-data "Permanent link")

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents.

This page collects resources relating to binary data in n8n.

## Working with binary data in your workflows [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/#working-with-binary-data-in-your-workflows "Permanent link")

You can process binary data in n8n workflows. n8n provides nodes to help you work with binary data. You can also use code.

### Nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/#nodes "Permanent link")

There are three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

There are separate nodes for working with XML and HTML data:

- [HTML](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/)
- [XML](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/)

And nodes for performing common tasks:

- [Compression](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.compression/)
- [Edit Image](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage/)
- [FTP](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ftp/)

You can trigger a workflow based on changes to a local file using the [Local File trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).

To split or concatenate binary data items, use the [data transformation nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/data/#data-transformation-nodes).

### Code [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/#code "Permanent link")

You can use the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/) to manipulate binary data in your workflows. For example, [Get the binary data buffer](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/): get the binary data available in your workflow.

## Configure binary data mode when self-hosting [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/binary-data/#configure-binary-data-mode-when-self-hosting "Permanent link")

You can configure how your self-hosted n8n instance handles binary data using the [Binary data environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data/). This includes tasks such as setting the storage path and choosing how to store binary data.

Your configuration affects how well n8n scales: [Scaling \| Binary data filesystem mode](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/binary-data/).

Reading and writing binary files can have security implications. If you want to disable reading and writing binary data, use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables \| Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.

## Looping in n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#looping-in-n8n)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/looping.md "Edit this page")

# Looping in n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#looping-in-n8n "Permanent link")

Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.

## Using loops in n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n "Permanent link")

n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

[![The Customer Datastore node output](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:

1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
2. Configure the parameters.
3. Execute the node.

You would receive five messages: one for each item.

This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.

### Executing nodes once [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#executing-nodes-once "Permanent link")

For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.

## Creating loops [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#creating-loops "Permanent link")

n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.

### Loop until a condition is met [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#loop-until-a-condition-is-met "Permanent link")

To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop.

Here is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:

[![Editor UI view of sample workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)

### Loop until all items are processed [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#loop-until-all-items-are-processed "Permanent link")

Use the [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.

You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.

The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.

## Node exceptions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions "Permanent link")

Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:

- [CrateDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
- [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
- [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.
- [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
- [Microsoft SQL](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
- [MongoDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
- [QuestDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.
- [Redis](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):
  - Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
- [RSS Read](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rssfeedread/) executes once for the requested URL.
- [TimescaleDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.

## White Labelling n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#white-labelling)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/white-labelling.md "Edit this page")

# White labelling [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#white-labelling "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

White labelling n8n means customizing the frontend styling and assets to match your brand identity. The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n):

- [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system): n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components
- [packages/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui): n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Prerequisites [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#prerequisites "Permanent link")

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

Create a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) and clone your new repository.

|                  |                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>` | `<br>git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n<br>cd n8n<br>` |

Install all dependencies, build and start n8n.

|                       |                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>` | `<br>npm install<br>npm run build<br>npm run start<br>` |

Whenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes.

## Theme colors [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#theme-colors "Permanent link")

To customize theme colors open [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system) and start with:

- [packages/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss)
- [packages/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss)

At the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:

|                            |                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>` | `<br>@mixin theme {<br>	--color-primary-h: 6.9;<br>	--color-primary-s: 100%;<br>	--color-primary-l: 67.6%;<br>` |

In the following example the primary color changes to #0099ff. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp).

|                            |                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>` | `<br>@mixin theme {<br>	--color-primary-h: 204;<br>	--color-primary-s: 100%;<br>	--color-primary-l: 50%;<br>` |

[![Example Theme Color Customization](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/color-transition.gif)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/color-transition.gif)

## Theme logos [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#theme-logos "Permanent link")

To change the editor’s logo assets look into [packages/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui/public) and replace:

- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- n8n-logo.svg
- n8n-logo-collapsed.svg
- n8n-logo-expanded.svg

Replace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:

- [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue): top/left logo in the main sidebar.
- [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/Logo.vue): reused in other components.

In the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.

[![Example Logo Main Sidebar](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/logo-main-sidebar.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/logo-main-sidebar.png)

If your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue).

|                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Text localization [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#text-localization "Permanent link")

To change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json).

n8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages).

In the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue).

|                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>` | `<br>{<br>	"_brand.name": "My Brand",<br>	//replace n8n with link to _brand.name<br>	"about.aboutN8n": "About @:_brand.name",<br>	"about.n8nVersion": "@:_brand.name Version",<br>}<br>` |

[![Example About Modal Localization](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/about-modal.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/about-modal.png)

### Window title [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/#window-title "Permanent link")

To change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:

- [packages/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/index.html)
- [packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts)

The following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `titleChange.ts`.

|                                      |                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

|                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) offers the following advantages:

- Installs n8n in a clean environment.
- Easier setup for your preferred database.
- Can avoid issues due to different operating systems, as Docker provides a consistent system.
- Can avoid compatibility issues due to differences in operating systems and tools.
- Makes migrating to new hosts or environments more straightforward.

You can also use n8n in Docker with [Docker Compose](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/docker-compose/). You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

## Prerequisites [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Before proceeding, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Linux Users

Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. Linux users must install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) individually for your distribution.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.86.1

Current `next`: 1.88.0

## Starting n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#starting-n8n "Permanent link")

From your terminal, run:

|                       |                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>` | `<br>docker volume create n8n_data<br>docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n<br>` |

This command creates a volume to store persistent data, downloads the required n8n image, and starts your container, exposed on port `5678`. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `n8n_data`, to persist your data locally.

Once running, you can access n8n by opening:
[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/)

## Using with PostgreSQL [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#using-with-postgresql "Permanent link")

By default, n8n uses SQLite to save [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n), past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgreSQL, configurable using environment variables as detailed below.

When using PostgreSQL, it's still important to persist the data stored in the `/home/node/.n8n` folder. This includes n8n user data and, even more importantly, the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when using the [n8n tunnel](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel).

If n8n can't find the `/home/node/.n8n` directory on startup, it automatically creates one. In this case, all existing credentials that n8n saved with a different encryption key will no longer work.

Keep in mind

While persisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory with PostgreSQL is the recommended best practice, it's not explicitly required. You can provide the encryption key by passing the [`N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) when starting your Docker container.

To use n8n with PostgreSQL, execute the following commands, replacing the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets, for example `<POSTGRES_USER>`) with your actual values:

|                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>` | `<br>docker volume create n8n_data<br>docker run -it --rm \<br> --name n8n \<br> -p 5678:5678 \<br> -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \<br> -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \<br> -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \<br> -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \<br> -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \<br> -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \<br> -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \<br> -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \<br> docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n<br>` |

You can find a complete `docker-compose` file for PostgreSQL in the [n8n hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).

## Setting timezone [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#setting-timezone "Permanent link")

To define the timezone n8n should use, you can set the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Schedule-oriented nodes, like the [Schedule Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) use this to determine the correct timezone.

You can set the system timezone, which controls what some scripts and commands like `date` return, using the `TZ` environment variable.

This example sets the same timezone for both variables:

|                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>` | `<br>docker volume create n8n_data<br>docker run -it --rm \<br> --name n8n \<br> -p 5678:5678 \<br> -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \<br> -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \<br> -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \<br> docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n<br>` |

## Updating [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#updating "Permanent link")

To update n8n, in Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:

[![Docker Desktop](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:

|                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>` | `<br># Pull latest (stable) version<br>docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n<br># Pull specific version<br>docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:1.81.0<br># Pull next (unstable) version<br>docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next<br>` |

After pulling the updated image, stop your n8n container and start it again. You can also use the command line. Replace `<container_id>` in the commands below with the container ID you find in the first command:

|                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>` | `` <br># Find your container ID<br>docker ps -a<br># Stop the container with the `<container_id>`<br>docker stop <container_id><br># Remove the container with the `<container_id>`<br>docker rm <container_id><br># Start the container<br>docker run --name=<container_name> [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n<br> `` |

### Updating Docker Compose [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#updating-docker-compose "Permanent link")

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

|                                                |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>` | `<br># Pull latest version<br>docker compose pull<br># Stop and remove older version<br>docker compose down<br># Start the container<br>docker compose up -d<br>` |

## Further reading [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#further-reading "Permanent link")

You can find more information about Docker setup in the README file for the [Docker image](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n).

## n8n with tunnel [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel "Permanent link")

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

|                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>` | `<br>docker volume create n8n_data<br>docker run -it --rm \<br> --name n8n \<br> -p 5678:5678 \<br> -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \<br> docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \<br> start --tunnel<br>` |

## Data Filtering Guide

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-filtering/#data-filtering)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-filtering.md "Edit this page")

# Data filtering [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-filtering/#data-filtering "Permanent link")

Feature availability

Available on Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans.

Search and filter data in the node **INPUT** and **OUTPUT** panels. Use this to check your node's data.

To search:

1. In a node, select **Search**![Search icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/search.png) in the **INPUT** or **OUTPUT** panel.
2. Enter your search term.

n8n filters as you type your search, displaying the objects or rows containing the term.

Filtering is purely visual: n8n doesn't change or delete data. The filter resets when you close and reopen the node.

## Data Editing in n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/#data-editing)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-editing.md "Edit this page")

# Data editing [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/#data-editing "Permanent link")

n8n allows you to edit [pinned data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/). This means you can check different scenarios without setting up each scenario and sending the relevant data from your external system. It makes it easier to test edge cases.

For development only

Data editing isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Edit output data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/#edit-output-data "Permanent link")

To edit output data:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
3. Select **Edit**![Edit data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/edit-data.png).
4. Edit your data.
5. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.

## Use data from previous executions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/#use-data-from-previous-executions "Permanent link")

You can copy data from nodes in previous workflow executions:

1.  Open the left menu.
2.  Select **Executions**.
3.  Browse the workflow executions list to find the one with the data you want to copy.
4.  Select **Open Past Execution**![Open past execution icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/open-execution.png).
5.  Double click the node whose data you want to copy.
6.  If it's table layout, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
7.  There are two ways to copy the JSON:
8.  Select the JSON you want by highlighting it, like selecting text. Then use `ctrl` \+ `c` to copy it.
9.  Select the JSON you want to copy by clicking on a parameter. Then:
    1. Hover over the JSON. n8n displays the **Copy**![Copy data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/copy-data.png) button.
    2. Select **Copy**![Copy data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/copy-data.png).
    3. You can choose what to copy:
       - **Copy Item Path** and **Copy Parameter Path** gives you expressions that access parts of the JSON.
       - **Copy Value**: copies the entire selected JSON.
10. Return to the workflow you're working on:
    1. Open the left menu.
    2. Select **Workflows**.
    3. Select **Open**.
    4. Select the workflow you want to open.
11. Open the node where you want to use the copied data.
12. If there is no data, run the node to load data.
13. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
14. Select **Edit**![Edit data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/edit-data.png).

## Merging Data in n8n

[Skip to content](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/merging/#merging-data)

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/merging.md "Edit this page")

# Merging data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/merging/#merging-data "Permanent link")

Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.

- Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.
- Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.
- Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.

Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.

## Merge data from different data streams [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/merging/#merge-data-from-different-data-streams "Permanent link")

If your workflow [splits](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/)

## Merge data from different nodes [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/merging/#merge-data-from-different-nodes "Permanent link")

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

[![Merging data from two previous nodes. The diagram shows three nodes lined up sequentially. The first node is labeled Fetch data, the second is labeled Modify data, and the third is labeled Merge: append both data sets. Arrows connect nodes 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/merging/merge-node-data.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/merging/merge-node-data.png) Merging data from two previous nodes

## Merge data from multiple node executions [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/merging/#merge-data-from-multiple-node-executions "Permanent link")

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/) scenarios.

Node executions and workflow executions

This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/) using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

## Data Transformation Guide

[Edit this page](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/transforming-data.md "Edit this page")

# Transforming data [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/transforming-data/#transforming-data "Permanent link")

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

[![HTTP Request node output](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/transforming-data/HTTPRequest_output.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/transforming-data/HTTPRequest_output.png)

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:

- [Aggregate](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- [Limit](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
- [Remove Duplicates](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
- [Sort](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
- [Split Out](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
- [Summarize](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Facebook Lead Ads credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookleadads/#facebook-lead-ads-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookleadads/#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

- OAuth2

## Related resources [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookleadads/#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Facebook Lead Ads' documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/guides/lead-ads/) for more information about the service.

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-lead-ads-trigger/) on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2 [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookleadads/#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To get both, [create a Meta app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) with either the Facebook Login product or the Facebook Login for Business product.

To create your app and set up the credential with **Facebook Login for Business**:

1.  Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
2.  If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
3.  Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
4.  Select **Business** and **Next**.
5.  Complete the essential information:
    - Add an **App name**.
    - Add an **App contact email**.
    - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
6.  Select **Create app**. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
7.  Select **Facebook Login for Business**. The **Settings** page for this product opens.
8.  Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential.
9.  In your Meta app settings in **Client OAuth settings**, paste that URL as the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**.
10. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
11. Copy the **App ID** and enter it as the **Client ID** within your n8n credential.
12. Copy the **App Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** within your n8n credential.

Your credential should successfully connect now, but you'll need to go through the steps to take your Meta app live before you can use it with the [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger/). Here's a summary of what you'll need to do:

1. In your Meta app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
2. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
3. Select **Save changes**.
4. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
5. Facebook Login for Business requires Advanced Access for `public_profile`. To add it, go to **App Review > Permissions and Features**.
6. Search for `public_profile` and select **Request advanced access**.
7. Complete the steps for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-verified-for-business/).
8. Use the [Lead Ads Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) to trigger some demo form submissions and test your workflow.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish \| App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).
